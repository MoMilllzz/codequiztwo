# codequiztwo

What I did:
Created the HTML and CSS pages
For the Javascript:
I first gathered all HTML elements for manipulation
Then created the quiz questions object + other global variables
The first function cycles through the object array containing the quiz questions to generate the questions + answers
The second function is starting the quiz function, starts the time ranges, hides the start button and displays the 1st quiz question
Then I created the timer
The third function is the end page screen that displays your score after you complete the quiz or if the timer runs out
Once you click the submit button, we run the function high score that saves and stringifies the array of high scores already saved in local storage as well as pushing the new user name + score into the array we are saving in local storage
Then it runs the function to show high scores 
The fourth function clears the list for the highscores and generates a new high score list from local storage
The fifth function displays the high scores page while hiding all of the other pages
The sixth function clears the local storage of the high scores as well as clearing the text from the high score board
The seventh function sets all the variables back to their origional values and shows the home page to allow re-play of the quiz
The eigth function checks the response to each answer
And at the bottom there is the button that will actually start the quiz :)
